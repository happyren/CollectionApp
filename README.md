![Repo Profile Pic](https://github.com/happyren/CollectionApp/blob/master/repository-open-graph-template.png)

Getting a full collection of things is satisfying, but it could be tedious in the progress.

*This platform aims to help you track your collection progress*

**Currently this project works as a testing field for the concept using [Gunpla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_model) as the target.**

## Why?

This is a practice project for me to get used to dotnet development for the most part. 

I spent days to think of a great project idea, being influnced heavily by the collection concept in video games, I decided to build a real life collection app.

This is my testing field, hone my skills will be the major target!!!

~~Also I learnt this idea was implemented years ago by gunpla fans.~~

## What have I done so far?

I have already get the api up and running.

- [x] It implements the Repository pattern for app-db data transmission.

- [x] Data Transmission Object(DTO) is used for data accessing from its client.

- [x] It uses AutoMapper to handle model to dto mapping (vice versa).

- [x] SQLite is used for the development, this is due to change when bring it into production mode.

- [x] JWT is the choice of authentication token.
